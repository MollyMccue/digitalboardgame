            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>The inspiration for this digital board game was materialized from the combination of Candy Land and The SCP Foundation. For those who donâ€™t know, The SCP Foundation is a fictional secret organization documented by the collaborative-writing wiki project. SCP simply means to secure, contain, and protect. This game was created to add a dark and scary twist on your average Candy Land.</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p>The narrative of this game is that the player is trapped in an unknown area and is trying to run across the board to escape the SCP monsters and make it to the end portal. But this game is not played like the usual Candy Land. When you first enter the game choose a character, then draw a card and whatever color you get is where you go. If you draw a card with a two colored space you move twice and if you get a card with an image on it an event happens and you're instantly transported to the specific square no matter where you are. And lastly, if you draw a card with a trap space your turn gets skipped. The main objective is to make it past the other players and SCP monsters to jump through the end portal to win the game!</p>
