            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>The inspiration for the board game comes from a combination of candy<br>
            land and scp. The SCP Foundation is a fictional secret organization documented<br>
            by the collaborative-writing wiki project of the same name. SCP simply means<br>
            secure, contain and protect. This game was created to add a twist on your<br>
            average candy land. </p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p>This game is not played like the usual candy land. Since there is a twist on the<br>
            game there is also a twist on the ways to play and rules. When entering the game<br>
            choose character. Then draw your card. The round your playing and show turn it<br>
            is will show. The point of this game is to escape the scp. To move you will be<br>
            showed a card with a color on it. If it has one move to the color. If it has two of<br>
            the same colors on it move two of those colors. If you get a card with a flashlight,<br>
            mask move to the square no matter where you are. If you get on any of the traps<br>
            your turn gets skipped.</p>
